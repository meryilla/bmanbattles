Bomberman Battles... in Sven Co-op!
Made by Meryilla

=== INFO ===

QRD on how to play:

- Press the "USE" key to place a bomb on the tile you are on. Bombs remain non-solid until you leave the tile.
- Destroy the crates to advance through the arena and to collect powerups.
- Kill the other players! The round winner is the last man standing. Points also allocated to 2nd and 3rd places.

There are either 10 or 5 rounds in total, determined by a vote at map start. The map does not currently support >16 players.

Powerups:

- Bomb: Allows you place an extra bomb, up to a maximum of 3 at once.
- F: Extends range of bombs by 1, up to a maximum range of 3 tiles.
- Heart: Increases your health, allowing you to survive 1 bomb blast.
- Roller Skate: Increase speed.
- Skull: Recieve a random disease.

Diseases last until you either die, pick up another powerup, or touch another player (which transfers the disease to them).

Current diseases:

- Slow: Makes you slow as fuck.
- Fast: Makes you extremely fast (not as useful as it sounds!).
- Constipated: Cannot place bombs.
- Weak bombs: Reduces bomb range to 1.
- Diarrhea: Automatically places a bomb on every tile you walk on.

If anyone asks questions that are answered in this motd, tell them to RTFM.
